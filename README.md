Scraper for the [Australian Capital Territory Health](https://www.health.act.gov.au/)'s [register of food offences](http://www.health.act.gov.au/public-information/businesses/food-safety-regulation/register-food-offences).

When an individual or company is found guilty of an offence against the Food Act 2001, ACT Health publishes a summary of the conviction on the Register of Food Offences. Offences on the register may include the handling and/or sale of unsafe food, misleading conduct relating to the sale of food or failure to comply with the Australia New Zealand Food Standards Code. The information on each offence will generally be published for 2 years following any appeal period. Publication will not occur where the court has made an order preventing publication.
